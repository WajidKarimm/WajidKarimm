## 👋 Introduction (Kept Exactly as You Wrote It)

Hi there 👋  
I love exploring the ever-changing world of tech, diving into new programming languages and tools. I have decent experience with Python and enjoy learning emerging tools to become a better developer. Open-source projects are important to me, and I enjoy working with different teams. When I'm not coding, I like getting lost in a good book, enjoying nature, or having coffee with friends. Let's connect and start a coding adventure together!
