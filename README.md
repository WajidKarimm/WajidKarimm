Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Wajid Karim

"Bug? Nah, thatâ€™s a feature...


I love exploring the ever-changing world of tech, diving into new programming languages and tools. I have decent experience with Python and enjoy learning emerging tools to become a better developer. Open-source projects are important to me, and I enjoy working with different teams. When I'm not coding, I like getting lost in a good book, enjoying nature, or having coffee with friends. Let's connect and start a coding adventure together!
